# Mental Health Prediction from Online Survey
Team Members: Phoebe Gao, Yina Liang Li, Carol Wang, Yuri Xu, and Qian Zhao.

**Problem Statement**

Mental health issues, such as anxiety and depression, are increasingly prevalent, especially in the workplace.
Early prediction and intervention can significantly improve individuals' well-being and productivity.
In this project, we aim to predict whether an individual is likely to seek treatment for mental health conditions based on survey data, including information about their lifestyle, work environment, and demographic characteristics.
Early identification can help employers and healthcare providers offer better support and resources to those in need.

**Dataset Description**

Source: Kaggle – Mental Health in Tech Survey

Key Features:  
- Demographics: Age, Gender, Country 
- Workplace Factors: Remote work, Company size, Mental health benefits, Work interference
- Medical History: Family mental illness, Previous diagnosis, Past treatment
- Perceptions and Awareness: Comfort discussing mental health, Employer support
  
Target Variable:
- treatment: Whether the individual has sought treatment for a mental health condition (Yes/No)

**Quick Start Guide**

- Install Requirements: pip install -r requirements.txt

- Local Development
1. Preprocess Data: python data_preprocessing/preprocess.py
2. Train Model: python modeling/train_model.py
3. Run Fairness and Drift Monitoring: python drift_fairness/check_fairness.py
                                      python drift_fairness/monitor_drift.py
4. Launch FastAPI App: cd inference ,uvicorn api:app --reload, The API will be available at: http://127.0.0.1:8000/docs

- Docker Deployment
1. Build Docker Image:docker build -t mental-health-api .
2. Run Docker Container: docker run -p 8000:8000 mental-health-api

-  Continuous Integration (CI)  
Every push to the main branch triggers the GitHub Actions workflow to:

  1.Automatically build the Docker image
  
  2. Run unit tests in /tests/
     
  3. Validate the FastAPI server  
You can find the workflow file in .github/workflows/ci.yml.

**Key Results**

- Achieved 90% overall test accuracy on the mental health treatment prediction task.
- Implemented fairness auditing with demographic parity and equalized odds difference metrics.
- Deployed Dockerized FastAPI API and integrated CI/CD with GitHub Actions.
- Set up drift detection using Evidently AI for continuous monitoring.

**Methodology Overview**

Our end-to-end pipeline includes:
- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) to understand data distributions and patterns
- Model training and hyperparameter optimization (Logistic Regression, Random Forest, XGBoost)
- Model explainability with SHAP to interpret feature contributions
- Deployment of the final model as a live API using FastAPI and Docker
- Continuous Integration/Deployment (CI/CD) via GitHub Actions
- Fairness and drift monitoring to ensure model robustness over time

**Deployment Instructions**
-  How to Build the Docker Image
-  - Make sure you are in the project root directory.
Then run the following command to build the Docker image: docker build -t mental-health-api .
