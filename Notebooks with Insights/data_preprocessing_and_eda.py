*The 'Timestamp', 'no_employees', 'anonymity' columns are being removed since it is irrelevant in this use case.*

*There are missing values in columns like 'state', 'self_employed', 'work_interfere', and 'Comments'.*

*There are missing values (41%) in the 'state' column due to the fact that it only shows the state only for participants who answered 'United States' for the country variable. Therefore, we remove the 'state column since we can visualize the survey insights by referring to the 'Country' variable.*

*The 'self_employed' variable has a few missing values (1.4%), we proceed to replace the missing values with the mode or most frequent answer, that is either 'yes' or 'no'.*

*The 'Comments' column is being removed due to highly missing values/comments for 87% of the data (1095 rows).*

*Moreover, we can also observe that the 'Age' column contains some extreme values like a maximum of 1e+11 and minimum of -1726, where it needs cleaning. Therefore, we proceed to keep only the reasonable range of age from 18 to 100.*
