This folder contains the individual work processes contributed by different teammates for various parts and roles of the project.

Each Jupyter notebook includes:

- Detailed workflows for data preprocessing, analysis, or modeling
- Markdown explanations to provide insights, reasoning, and key takeaways
- Intermediate steps, exploration, and decision points leading to the final deliverables
Note: These notebooks serve as a record of the collaborative efforts during project development.
Finalized results and production-ready code are organized separately in the main repository.
