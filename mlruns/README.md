 MLruns

This folder contains the experiment tracking logs generated by MLflow during model training and evaluation.

 What is inside?

- Each numbered subfolder (0/, 498834162165687949/, 651994717234247678/) corresponds to an MLflow experiment.
- Every experiment folder logs:
  - Model parameters
  - Metrics (e.g., Accuracy, F1-score)
  - Artifacts (e.g., saved models)
  - Metadata (start/end time, status)
These records allow reproducibility, performance comparison, and model versioning over time.

 How was MLflow used?

- During each training script run (e.g., train_xgboost.py, train_catboost.py), MLflow automatically:
  -Logged hyperparameters
  - Logged training/validation metrics
  - Saved the final model artifacts
- The tracking server was local, writing into this mlruns/ directory by default.

Note

- This folder is auto-generated by MLflow.
- Do not manually modify files inside unless you are familiar with the MLflow structure.
